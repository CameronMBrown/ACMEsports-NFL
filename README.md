# ACMEsports-NFL

The Problem: 
Our fake client, ACME Sports, wants to display a dynamic list of NFL teams on a page on its 
website. It’s dynamic because the site will pull the NFL team data from a remote API that is 
frequently updated. 

This is ACME Sports’ first website and they don’t understand tech, UX or SEO. So, they are 
relying on you for all aspects of this initiative – user experience, SEO and technical 
implementation. 

• The API endpoint URL with the NFL team data is below. Please assume that the API
provides no other functionality other than to return the team list in JSON format.

• You can assume the API will always return the teams in the exact same format, with the
exact same field names and data types.
• You decide what functionality the page provides. Maybe you list the teams in a simple
table? Maybe you provide a method of sorting the team order? Maybe you separate the
teams by conference or division? ACME Sports trusts you – you decide what makes
sense!
